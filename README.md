This is a small standalone front-end application that provides the functionality to visualize tabular data. The application is designed to be completely adaptive, supporting paging and sorting of the table. It also allows for customizable layout and design parameters via separate controls.


## Features

- Visualization of tabular data with adaptive display
- Support for paging and sorting of the table
- Customizable layout parameters via separate forms
- Colorization of table cells based on number values
- Error handling for API errors and data validation
- Pleasing and modern frontend appearance
- Code secured with tests at reasonable places


## Usage
Visualization of Tabular Data: The application provides a visually appealing and adaptive display of tabular data. The data is presented in a structured and organized manner for easy comprehension.

-  Paging and Sorting: Users can navigate through the table using paging controls and sort the data based on different columns to facilitate data analysis.
- Customizable Layout and Design: Separate forms are available to customize the layout and design parameters of the table. Users can adjust  -- parameters such as border, colors, margin, padding, and more to tailor the appearance of the table according to their preferences.
- Colorization of Table Cells: Users can specify a column for colorization based on number values. This feature enhances the visual representation of the data and aids in identifying patterns or trends.
- Error Handling: The application includes robust error handling to manage API errors and data validation. Users are provided with informative feedback in case of errors, ensuring a smooth user experience.
- Pleasing and Modern Frontend Appearance: The frontend is designed to have a pleasing and modern appearance, offering an intuitive and visually appealing user interface.

Getting Started



## To run the application locally, follow these steps:


## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `yarn start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `yarn test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `yarn build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `yarn eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
